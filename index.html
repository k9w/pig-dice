        <h3>How to Play</h3>
        <p>1: Click "NEW GAME" <br>2: Current player clicks "ROLL" to roll dice and "HOLD" to finish turn. <br> 3: First player to finish their turn with 100 points WINS!!! <br><br>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":<br><br>
  
          If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
          If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
          If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's
          turn.<br><br>
  
          The first player to score 100 or more points wins.<br><br>
  
          For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5. Donald could hold and score 5 points, but
          chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again.
          Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5,
          after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score. </p>
